**What are two common ways of organising information?

Communication Design - Organising information and messages expressed throigh the creative use of visual language witch is trageted towards a particular audience. Te importantce of this process is to information
and considerations around how messages are transformed through being communicated via particular mediums. 

Interactive Information Design - (IID) it iswhen design becomes a process, once somehting is porduced it nevr is finished there are constatly coming with updates and listening the user to make changes that will benefit the ap for the user. 
"An amalgamation of aspects of these fields, which haveparticular significance for Digital Media Designers". (Deseing for reconfiguration)

**Name one of the key challenges for interactive information designers.

The products that designers make are for the use of other individuals. Therefore understanding the user is very importnat. IS about a group of people and who they are what they do. MEaning thta there is the need to make something comprehensible for others to use.

There 4 main points thta need to be consodered. The medium (the opportunitoes and limitations), the level of understanding of the user (their understanding of visual language), the necessity of the communication, how fast must these ideas be communivated. Once the medium is fully fucntionable the re is the need to adpt it asthetically for the target audiece.

**Through reviewing the ‘Bootcamp Bootleg’ PDF (available from here: https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/the-bootcamp-bootleg) choose one method and concisely explain the situation/circumstances where it would be most useful as a designer.

Bodystorming

Is a tectnique used to help generate ideas as the medium thta is been used might have aphysical interaction.
Requires a physical test as it is a technique that requires physcial experience in oreder to generate new ideas.

This tehcniques is most usefull for designers when they emerge themselves in situations similer to the user therefoer they can get an experience thta is diffrent from the main point of view of the designer and possibly improve the product for 5the user. "If you are designing products for the elderly, rub some Vaseline on your glasses to view the
world through older eyes", placing youself as a designer in the users shoes.
