**Name three digital media pioneers mentioned in this week’s lecture.**
 
 Ben Laposky
 
 Jean Bartik (1924 - 2011) - How to guide messiles. Conecting diffrent circuits together.
 
Grace Hopper - Programing language
 
**Provide an explanation of their contribution and why it’s significant.**

Ben Laposky - used a occisloscope, Which is a scientific device used for mesoring, he used this to make art. making this very unique and "impossible" fro the time

Jean Bartil - became a programer in the first large scale computer, which was used to calculate missile trajectories using cables and circuits.

Grace Hopper - created a language which allowed programers to communicate with teh computer in english which was a massive change for the programming world. This concept followed this idea of data abstraction which means that there a distance created between the hardware and the programmer. This later allowed for the development of other languages such as JavaScript and swift whihc are C++ menaing Simon - " low-level languages, which allow detailed control
of the computer (such as C++) to high-level languages such as Apple’s Swift language."

**Name two practitioners mentioned in this week’s lecture whose work clearly straddles traditional art and science divides.**

Ben Laposky

Daphne Oram (1925 – 2003)
Machine Electronic Music Pioneer.
In the 1960's she assembeld a masterpiece of musical engeneering, had to imagen electronic sounds that she could not make. 
The sounds were genrated by drawing on glass, and these analogue shapes where traslated by elactronics to create elctronic music, whcih we now know as DJ's.

**Explain the significance of one of the cultural theories discussed in today’s lecture.**

Intertwingularity (no internet yet but it followws the sam principle
There is a structre rather than a ist. However writing was sequencial and tehrefore culturaly his idea was first rejecteed.

//When Computers where Women\\

Even though women took a large part in the developemnt of the computer, they were omited from history.ENIAC’s “invention” with special focus on the female technicians whom existing computer histories have rendered invisible, this avery large ethical issue as tehy were onluy seen as house wifes. However, between 30 and 50 percent of programmers were women in the 1950s, and it was seen as a natural career for them, as evidenced by a 1967 Cosmopolitan feature about “Computer Girls.”
