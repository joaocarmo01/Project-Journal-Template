Lakoff and Johnson (1980) state that "our ordinary conceptual system, in terms we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" and define the essence of metaphor as "understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another" They further posit that "meaning and value are grounded in the nature of our bodies and brains, and in our physical, social, and cultural environments" and place the bodily, or sensorial perception in the centre of their theory claiming that embodied image–schemas conceptualize our experience at a non–propositional level (Johnson 1992:349). : http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=728
